# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will capture and include the client's IP address when creating a new chat session. The IP address will be automatically detected on the frontend and sent to the backend during chat creation. This information will be stored in the existing `ipAddress` column in the PostgreSQL database and can be used for analytics, security, and support purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a support administrator, I want to capture the client's IP address when they start a chat, so that I can track user locations and identify potential security issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer creates a new chat THEN the system SHALL automatically detect their IP address
2. WHEN the chat creation request is sent THEN the system SHALL include the IP address in the CREATE_CHAT mutation
3. WHEN the IP address is successfully captured THEN the system SHALL store it in the database ipAddress column
4. IF the IP address detection fails THEN the system SHALL still allow chat creation with a null IP address

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the IP address detection to be reliable and non-blocking, so that chat functionality remains available even if IP detection fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN IP address detection is attempted THEN the system SHALL use a reliable third-party service or browser API
2. WHEN IP detection takes longer than 3 seconds THEN the system SHALL proceed without the IP address
3. WHEN IP detection fails THEN the system SHALL continue with chat creation
4. WHEN the chat is created successfully THEN the IP address SHALL be available in the chat data for display and analytics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a customer, I want the chat creation process to remain fast and seamless, so that IP address detection doesn't impact my user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start a new chat THEN the IP address detection SHALL not add noticeable delay to the chat creation process
2. WHEN IP address detection is in progress THEN the chat creation form SHALL remain responsive
3. WHEN the chat is created THEN I SHALL not see any indication that IP address detection occurred
4. IF IP address detection fails THEN my chat creation SHALL proceed normally without any error messages
