# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the chat widget application from Create React App (CRA) to Vite build system. The migration aims to improve build performance, reduce bundle size, and provide better optimization for an embeddable chat widget that needs to be lightweight and fast-loading when embedded on client websites. The migration should maintain all existing functionality while improving the development experience and production build output.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Create React App to Vite, so that I can have faster development builds and better performance for the embeddable chat widget.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL build using Vite instead of react-scripts
2. WHEN running the development server THEN the application SHALL start faster than the current CRA setup
3. WHEN building for production THEN the bundle size SHALL be optimized for embedding in external websites
4. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing npm scripts SHALL work with equivalent functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain all existing functionality during the migration, so that no features are lost or broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all React components SHALL function identically to the current implementation
2. WHEN the application runs THEN all GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions SHALL work without modification
3. WHEN the application loads THEN all CSS styling and Semantic UI components SHALL render correctly
4. WHEN the chat widget is embedded THEN it SHALL maintain the same embedding capabilities as before

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Vite specifically for a chat widget, so that the build output is optimized for embedding on external websites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN the output SHALL be configured as a library suitable for embedding
2. WHEN the widget is embedded THEN it SHALL not conflict with the host website's styles or JavaScript
3. WHEN building THEN the bundle SHALL include all necessary dependencies without requiring external CDN links
4. WHEN the widget loads THEN it SHALL have minimal impact on the host website's performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain the same development workflow, so that the team can continue working without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running development commands THEN they SHALL use the same npm script names (start, build, test)
2. WHEN developing THEN hot module replacement SHALL work for React components
3. WHEN building THEN environment variables SHALL be handled the same way as before
4. WHEN testing THEN the existing test setup SHALL continue to work

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure proper handling of assets and public files, so that the embedded widget loads all resources correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds THEN all assets in the public folder SHALL be properly included
2. WHEN the widget is embedded THEN favicon and manifest files SHALL not interfere with the host website
3. WHEN building THEN CSS files SHALL be properly bundled and scoped to avoid conflicts
4. WHEN the application loads THEN all image and static assets SHALL resolve correctly
